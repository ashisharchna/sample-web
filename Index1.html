<h3> How Important Is This game to Me? </h3>
<p> Over the past year, I have played this game for over 400 hours on both PC and Xbox 1, and I have played it nonstop sometimes when I didn't have work to accomplish. </p>

<li> Defense Heroes (Heroes that excel in defending objectives, also dealing a lot of damage. </li>
<li> Tank Heroes (Heroes that have a lot more Health than the other 3 groups, so they excel at taking damage for the team) </li>
<li> Support Heroes (Heroes that well, provide support for the other heroes, usually in the form of healing them so they do not get eliminated as easily) </li>
